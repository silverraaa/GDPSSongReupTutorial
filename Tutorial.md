# GDPS Song Reuploading Tutorial
This tutorial is just short and simple, you're not gonna have too many problems with it!
Since some people are having problems with reuploading songs on their GDPSs (Song not playing, Corrupted Song problems & etc.) well i have this tutorial for you! :)

I recommend you do this on a browser (because of yeah song downloading and reupload) and as well Discord browser.

# Step 1: Getting/Downloading the song
Get the song that you need to reupload on Youtube, copy the video link of it and go to this converter site!

# Step 2: Uploading the song into a Discord Attachment link
Now since you have now downloaded the MP3 of your song, open your Discord and send the MP3 on the server (i recommend doing this into a private Discord server so it won't get messy)

# Step 3: Reuploading the song
After you upload the song on a discord server, right click the song name of the MP3 and click "Copy link address". And head over to the Tools site of your GDPS and find the Song Reupload section, paste the link that you copied earlier and click "Add Song"! Then you're done! Copy the Song ID of what you've reuploaded and enjoy making levels!

## Having Problems putting 7 digit on Mobile?
Its hard for some people when getting/typing 7 digit songs on their phones, but good thing there's a solution for that!

- For this you'll have to verify & upload an empty level on the GDPS
- Go on the comments and comment "!song (Song ID)"
- Refresh the level and you're set!

(you can delete the level after you got the 7 digit song)
